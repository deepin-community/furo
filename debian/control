Description: clean customisable Sphinx documentation theme
 Furo is a clean customisable Sphinx documentation theme ...
  - Intentionally minimal — the most important thing is the content,
    not the scaffolding around it.
  - Responsive — adapting perfectly to the available screen space,
    to work on all sorts of devices.
  - Customisable — change the color palette, font families, logo and more!
  - Easy to navigate — with carefully-designed sidebar navigation and
    inter-page links.
  - Good looking content — through clear typography and well-stylised elements.
  - Good looking search — helps readers find what they want quickly.
  - Biased for smaller docsets — intended for smaller documentation sets,
    where presenting the entire hierarchy in the sidebar is not overwhelming.
